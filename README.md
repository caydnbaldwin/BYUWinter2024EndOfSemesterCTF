# BYU Winter 2024 End Of Semester CTF
BYU End of Semester Capture the Flag Winter 2024 Competition. This was my first ever CTF, I placed 9th out of ~56 competitors. I spent about 35 hours working on it during the 48-hour competition period.

## Experience
One of the leaders in the BYU CSA Club came to the class that I TA for and announced the CTF. I later asked my friend in BYU Men's Chorus about it and he invited me to tag along. The CTF was an individual competitor competition, however there were beginner challenges that the hosts could guide the newbies through. After receiving a lot of initial help, I slowly began working on my own and asking fewer questions, relying much more heavily on my googling skills. I eventually got the hang of things and progressed up the leaderboard.
