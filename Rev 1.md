## Writeup
Reverse Engineering challenge. Download `rev1`. Access the text within the file. For example: open WSL and enter `strings rev1`. The flag will be hidden in the output: `byuCTF{IH_c4n_f1nHd_4_str1Hng_sillyH`. Correct the obvious deviations. For example: change the last `H` to a `}`, then remove the new lines and all the other `H`.

**Flag** - `byuCTF{I_c4n_f1nd_4_str1ng_silly}`
